> 美国南北战争时期第十六任总统林肯的演讲，这个时间中国处于清朝同治二年，两宫太后慈禧、慈安正在垂帘听政与皇帝“同治”。

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

八十七年前，我们的父辈在这块陆地上建起一个新国家，它孕育于自由并奉行人人生而平等的主张。

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

如今我们正在进行一场伟大内战，考验着那个国家或任何有此信仰和主张的国家能否长久存续。我们在这场战争的伟大战场上集会，要把战场的一部分奉献给那些为国家存续献出生命的人作为最后的安息之所。我们应该这么做是合适和恰当的。

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow, this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
